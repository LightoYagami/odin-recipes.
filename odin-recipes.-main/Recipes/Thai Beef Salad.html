   <p>Not just another Thai Beef Salad….This is made with one little change to create a dressing from an award winning Thai restaurant, arguably one of the best in the world outside of Thailand!</p>
   </strong>
   
   <h4>Ingredients</h4>
   <ul>
     <li> 1 tbsp vegetable oil </li>
     <li>1 cup lime juice</li>
     <li>1 cup chopped fresh cilantro, plus more for garnish</li>
     <li> 1 cup chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
     <li> ½ cup white sugar</li>
     <li>⅓ cup fish sauce</li>
     <li>2 green onions, chopped</li>
     <li>1 stalk lemongrass, smashed and cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
     <li>1 tablespoon sweet chili sauce</li>
     <li>1 ½ pounds (1 inch thick) steak fillet</li>
     <li>1 head leaf lettuce - rinsed, dried and torn into bite-size pieces</li>
     <li>½ English cucumber, diced</li>
   <li> 1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
 </ul>  
 
 <h4>Steps</h4>
 <ol>
 <li>Mix lime juice, cilantro, mint leaves, sugar, fish sauce, green onions, lemongrass, and chili sauce together in a large bowl until sugar is dissolved. Adjust the flavor, if desired, by adding more sugar and/or fish sauce; set aside.</li>
  <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
  <li>Cook steak on the preheated grill until it begins to firm and is hot and slightly pink in the center, about 4 to 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).</li>
  <li>Transfer steak to a chopping board and slice into thin strips; add steak and its juices into the bowl with herb mixture. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours.</li>
  <li>Place lettuce in a salad bowl; arrange cucumber on top. Add steak and pour all of the herb mixture on top. Scatter cherry tomatoes over salad and garnish with fresh cilantro leaves.</li>
</ol>
